# Capstone Project 3 - Telco Customer Churn Dataset Machine Learning

In this project, I made a machine learning that could predict if a telco customer is going to churn or not, using the Telco Customer Churn Data as its base.

## Problem Statement
In the competitive telecommunication industry, customer churn happens all the time with a costly effects, with its cost 5-7 times higher than retaining the existing ones. With multiple competitors in the industry offering similar services, customer can easily switch providers for better pricing, more flexible contracts, or better service quality. As a result, telcos always face the constant threat of losing customers if they had missteps in handling their customers in their prices, poor customer service, technical issues or inadequate offerings. High churn rates can reduce profits and the customers' trust in the company, making it critical for companies to adopt a retention management strategy to protect their customers from jumping to another boat.

This project's machine learning model is aiming to help in predicting the likelihood which customers that will churn off from our services. Providing targeted retention management strategies and corners to be improved in the products.

## Goals
1. Create a model that can predict if a customer going to churn, applying retention strategy on customers predicted to churn.
2. Prepare retention strategies for predicted to churn customers.
3. See the importances for every features in the model, for future product development.
